Use a config file to define the details of the simulation you want to run. For a sample config file have look in /test/config.txt of this package. There are three sections to define:

    * initialization
    * simulation
    * analysis

Each of the section starts with a "%" and the section name. In the section
their parameters are specified using a simple keywords = value form.

Initialization
==============

This section defines, how many polyps should start the experiment, when they
are added to the simulation and what parameters should be simulated. Each polyp
is indicated by ">" followed by a random name which should be assigned to the
polyp. The name will not be preserved, rather an ID will be generated in the
form of a.1, a.2 ... a.N in the order of appearance of the config file. Each
polyp starts a subsection indicated by indentation, where the specific features
of the polyp is defined.


    startcells = [int]          defines how many cells a polyp should have in
                                the beginning of the simulation (default =
                                1000)
    proliferation = [float]     defines the proliferation rate of the cells in
                                the given time frame of tau (usually a value
                                between 0 an 1) (default = 0.8)
    tau = [float]               defines the time frame in which the fraction of
                                proliferating cells devide (default = 96)
    apoptosis = [float]         the fraction of cells which will go into the
                                apoptosis within the time frame of tau2
                                (between 0 and 1) (default = 0.17)
    tau2 = [float]              the time frame in which the fraction of
                                apoptotic cells will die (default = 72)
    max = [int]                 defines when the critical size is reached and
                                axis is broken to generate a new bud (default =
                                20000)
    budSize = [float]           defines the number of cells a bud has to obtain
                                before it is dropped from the mother polyp.
                                This is given as a fraction of max cells of the
                                mother polyp and must be between 0 and 1
                                (default = 0.45)
    budDevTime = [float]        the time a bud needs for development. Usually
                                something around 3.5 days at 18Â°C. Since this
                                is only a hint how long the bud develops and
                                what factors really determine bud development,
                                the implentation is somewhat unprecise. The
                                simulation will give shorter times for dT2
                                (difference scales with size of dT2), if
                                analyzed, because it does not consider the
                                proliferation within the bud. (default = 72)
    birth = [int]               gives the time step of the simulation when the
                                polyp observed within the simulation (usually 0
                                for the first polyp initialized). In general it
                                simply gives the timestep of the simulation
                                when a polyp is generated. (default = 0)
    unit = [str]                the unit of the timestep (default = h)
    stepsize = [int]            how large is a step in the simulation (default
                                = 1)


Simulation
==========

This section defines how the simulation should be run. There are three modes:
    * run for time
    * run for polyp number
    * run for time and polyp number
The first runs the simulation a certain number of simulation steps. The second
runs the simulation until the given number of polyps is reached. The third
combines both and runs as long as one of both conditions is met.

    byTime = [bool]             simulation by time? (default = False)
    byNumber = [bool]           simulation by polyp number? (default = True)
    time = [int]                how many timesteps should be simulated?
                                (default = None)
    number = [int]              how many polyps should be simulated least?
                                (default = 20)

Analysis
========

This section defines what data should be outputed. If nothing is defined here,
nothing will be written to disk and the simulation did only heat your room a
little. Following things can be analysed, the value given for each argument is
the path to the file which should be written.

    cellnumber = [str]          Returns a data frame for each timepoint (rows) in the
                                simulation with the current cell number of all
                                polyps (columns).
    population = [str]          This calculates the number of polyps for a
                                given time step (rows) and family (columns). It
                                will split the simulation in subfamilies by the
                                generation. The option requires two additional
                                arguments: the generation to split the
                                simulation at and a cutoff for polyp number per
                                family to discard families with fewer members
                                given in the cutoff argument.
        generation = [str]      A letter indicating the generation to split the
                                simulation in subfamilies. (default = b)
        cutoff = [int]          A number for the cutoff of family members to
                                discard families with only few members. (default =5)
    deltaTs = [str]             Calculates the deltaTs of all polyps over the
                                whole simualation.
    budInitiation = [str]       Returns a data frame for all polyps (columns)
                                and the timepoints (rows) of the initiation of
                                a bud
    budDrops = [str]            Returns a data frame for all polyps (columns)
                                and when they dropped a bud
